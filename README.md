# Notes Setup

It's a template for note taking setup!

Whenever we start with new project, this template can help to setup initial notes structure.

It contains folders for,
- Reusable (Resources you need frequently. Json, Image, XML, SQL etc.)
- Notes (Anything quickly you want to jot down for project.)
- Archive (Things you don't need anymore.)
- Rough (Scratch pad for writing anything and everything during the day.)
