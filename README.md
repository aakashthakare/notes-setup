# Notes Setup

It's a template for note taking setup!

Whenever we start with new project, this template can help to setup initial notes structure.

It contains folders for,
- Reusable (_Resources you need frequently. Json, Image, XML, SQL etc._)
- Notes (_Anything quickly you want to jot down for project._)
- Archive (_Things you don't need anymore._)
- Rough (_Scratch pad for writing anything and everything during the day._)
